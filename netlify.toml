  # Disable Netlify secrets scanning for Supabase public credentials
  # 
  # VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are PUBLIC by design:
  # - Anon key is meant to be exposed in frontend code
  # - Security comes from Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), not key secrecy
  # - This is standard Supabase architecture, not a security issue
  #
  # Sensitive keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, ALLOWED_ORIGIN) are stored as
  # Supabase Edge Function secrets, NOT in this repo or Netlify env vars.
